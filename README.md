The Water-Oil Ratio (WOR) is calculated by dividing the total water production by the total oil production for each well. High values of WOR indicate potential inefficiency, as more water is produced relative to oil. Well 4709502214 in Tyler county is the most inefficient , it is necessary to explore operational improvements, because by the other side Tyler county have the greatest production overall.
